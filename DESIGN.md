# How this board is built

One design, written down so it can be followed rather than guessed at. If you copy the kit and add a page, this is the agreement you are keeping.

## Colour

Colours live as custom properties on `:root` in `assets/css/styles.css`. Nothing in the stylesheet uses a raw colour value; if you need a new colour, it becomes a token first.

The system is light only. These boards are read at a desk in office light and on meeting-room projectors, so there is no dark theme to keep in step.

The two `theme-color` meta tags in every page head carry the same two grounds, so the browser's own bar matches the page it sits above.

| Token | Value | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--page` | `#F4F5F8` | The ground behind everything |
| `--card` | `#FFFFFF` | Panels, tiles, the menu, raised surfaces |
| `--subtle` | `#FAFBFC` | Table headings, row hover, the user block |
| `--field` | `#EEF0F4` | Inputs, chip backgrounds, tracks |
| `--ink` / `--ink-2` | `#0F172A` / `#334155` | Body text, then menu rows and table cells |
| `--muted` | `#5B6878` | Second-line text, labels, captions |
| `--faint` | `#94A3B8` | Placeholders and inactive icons only — never text to read |
| `--line` / `--line-soft` | `#E7E9EE` / `#F0F1F4` | Every surface edge, then row dividers |
| `--navy` / `--navy-deep` / `--navy-lift` | `#0E1B3D` / `#0A142E` / `#24407A` | The identity: the sign-in panel, the banner, the primary button |
| `--calm` / `--calm-lift` | `#0F3D2A` / `#1B6B47` | The banner when nothing is waiting |
| `--selected` | `#0E1B3D` | A chosen segment, the avatar |
| `--current-soft` / `--current-ink` | `#E4EEF7` / `#1B3A63` | The page you are on, in the menu |
| `--accent` / `--accent-ink` / `--accent-soft` | `#2F6FEB` / `#1D56C9` / `#EAF1FE` | **Movement, and nothing else** |
| `--bar` | `#2F6FEB` | The charts |
| `--group-1` … `--group-5` | navy / red / slate / stone / grey | Whatever dimension your charts split by |
| `--focus` | `#2F6FEB` | The focus ring |

There is one column because there is one theme. Anything that reads like a second theme
in this file is a mistake; the board is light only.

**A movement only takes a colour where the board can call it better or worse.** `movement(now, before, { good })` names the direction worth having; passing `good: null` states the move without a verdict. Volume (how many rows arrived) is stated that way, because more arriving is busier, not better. Standing still is neutral for the same reason. In a table the movement is a chip (`.status-well`, `.status-poor`, the neutral `.status-move`); under a figure it is words (see Figure cards below).

**Navy is the identity; the accent is a verb.** The blue accent is not the board's colour — it appears where something moved against the period before, and it is paired with a red of the same weight for movement the other way. That is why the menu's current page and the avatar have their own `--current-*` and `--selected` tokens rather than borrowing the accent: if the accent shows up anywhere that is not movement, it stops meaning movement. The one green on the board is `--calm`, and it means the opposite of movement: nothing is waiting.

**A group colour is a label, not a verdict.** `--group-2` is red because a set of distinguishable colours needs a red in it, not because that group is in trouble. Every chart that splits by group names the colours in its key, and a *state* always lives in a chip or a tinted card — never in a bar or a slice.

**The three status colours** carry meaning and are used nowhere decorative: red for stop, yellow for hold, green for go. Each has a soft fill, a hairline, an ink and a bar (`--green-soft`, `--green-line`, `--green-ink`, `--green-bar`, and the same for yellow and red), all defined once in the first `:root` of the stylesheet. Every `var(--…)` the stylesheet or a script uses is defined there: a token that is only named draws as nothing, and nothing on screen says why. On a chip they are `.status-stop`, `.status-hold` and `.status-good`; on a banner item they are `.is-stop` and `.is-hold`. Both draw from the same tokens, so one severity reads the same wherever it appears. There is deliberately no second green class — `.status-good` already is it.

**Contrast.** Every text colour measures at least 4.5:1 against the surface behind it, measured against its own tint rather than against the page.

## Type

Two faces, from Google Fonts — the only external resource the content security policy allows:

- **Geist** (400/500/600/700) for everything: headings, figures, running text and every control. One face, used at four weights, rather than a pairing that has to be kept in step.
- **Geist Mono** (500) for a figure that should read like an instrument — the reading on a chart, a key on a keyboard hint.

Both are set as `--heading`, `--body` and `--mono` in `:root`, each with a real fallback stack, so a page still reads if Google Fonts is blocked.

Figures use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` wherever they line up in a column, so a changing number does not shift the ones beside it.

**Labels are small, spaced and quiet.** A tile's name and a menu group heading are set at 11px, 600 weight, uppercase, `letter-spacing: .09em`, in `--muted`. The label recedes so the figure beside it carries the weight — the single cheapest way to make a board read as a considered document rather than a web page.

The body face matters more here than any colour. An earlier version of this kit used Nunito, a rounded humanist sans, and it undercut everything else on the page.

## Space and shape

**Three shapes, and nothing else.**

| Token | Size | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--radius` | 12px | Surfaces: panels, tiles, cards |
| `--radius-control` | 10px | Controls: buttons, inputs, selects, the menu, notices, the toast |
| `--radius-mark` | 4px | Marks: small bars and swatches |

Pills (`999px`) are for chips and counts only; `50%` is for avatars. Nothing else rounds its own corners.

**Elevation is declared once: a hairline, never both.** Every surface — panel, tile, drill-down tile, the menu column — is defined by a 1px `--line` border and carries no shadow at all. A 1px border sitting under a soft shadow is the ghost-card look, and it is the difference between a page that was designed and one that was assembled. A tile that is also a button shows its hover by moving its border and fill, not by lifting.

**The page rhythm is 22px.** `.app-main` spaces its children by 22px and `.grid` uses the same gap. Cards in a row stretch to the same depth, so nothing floats above a gap.

## Say each thing once

A board read on a Monday morning should say each fact in one place. When the same number sits in a status line, a banner, a figure card and a table, the reader has to check that they agree, and the page looks busier than what it knows. These are the defaults every board built from this kit starts with. They remove repetition and noise, never information somebody needs: anything taken off one place has a home somewhere else on the page.

- **Each fact once per page.** A number or a judgement lives in its one best home: the banner, a figure card, a panel or a table. The others do not repeat it.
- **One banner, with one message.** A page with a headline message gets one navy banner. No figure card repeats the banner's figure, and the banner does not repeat a count that a panel below it already shows.
- **A figure card is a label, the figure and one muted line.** No chip, no small chart, no footer. If the run behind a figure matters, it gets a table or a panel of its own.
- **No two controls with the same destination** on one page. A banner button and a panel link that open the same list are one too many.
- **The filter row keeps what people change.** The rest sit behind **More filters**.
- **"Showing N of M" appears only while something is filtered.** Unfiltered, the page's own figures already say how many it counts.
- **Page actions go in the header,** beside Refresh (`addHeaderAction()`), never orphaned at the foot of the page. Print is hidden on a phone. An export that saves one table sits in that table's panel head.
- **A page subtitle is one line.**

## What a figure has to do

These are design decisions, not missing work. They are the reason the kit exists.

- **A figure says what it does not prove.** Every tile carries an (i) with the counting rule and the limit. A tile without one is not finished. `tools/check-tiles.js` enforces it: it reads every `statTile` call on every page, and exits non-zero naming the file, the line and the label of any tile with a figure and no `about`.
- **Blank is not proof.** A row with nothing recorded means nobody wrote anything down — not that nothing happened. Every figure that counts blanks says so beside itself.
- **Keep separate things separate.** Supply, speed and quality are three measures. Averaging them into one score produces a number that means nothing.
- **Use the middle value, not the average,** wherever one very old row could drag it.
- **Do not invent a rate you cannot support.** If two things are not joined in the data, the board says they are not joined rather than dividing one by the other.
- **Nothing here judges a person.** Note quality is measured on length alone, because length is the only thing the text can honestly be read for.

## Components

- **The menu** — a light column on `--card`, held off the page by a hairline. The page you are on is a soft navy pill with a thin navy ring, drawn from `--current-soft`; everything else is `--muted` until hovered. A page the viewer may not open stays in the list, greyed, with a **Managers** tag. The gaps, padding and row height are sized against the window with `clamp()`, with two `max-height` steps for a short laptop screen, so the menu does not scroll. A finger still gets a 44px row through `@media (pointer: coarse)`.
- **The page header** — the page name, its one-line note, the board search and the refresh button, closed by a hairline. It is built in the script rather than read from the markup, so a browser holding an older copy of the HTML still gets the current header.
- **One visible search at a time.** A page that filters its own rows already has a field for it, so the board-wide search folds into a button carrying the key that opens it (`/`). Two fields side by side, doing different jobs and looking alike, told a first-time reader nothing. Escape shuts it, clears it and puts focus back on the button.
- **Figure cards (`.tile`)** — the figure's name, the figure, and one muted line (`.tile-line`): its base, what the figure is out of or what it leaves out, and, where it moved against the period before, the movement in words: *43 of 45 replies · Down 1% on the 4 weeks before*. Only the lead of the movement (*Down 1%*) takes a colour, green or red, and only where `movement()` was told which direction is worth having; volume and "no change" stay grey. Built by `statTile({ label, value, note, verdict, about, watch })` with `verdict: changeWords(movement(…))`. There is no chip, no footer and no small chart inside a card: each one repeated a panel lower on the page, and a run with no scale could not be read anyway. Where the run behind a figure matters, it gets a table (Today's **The last six weeks**) or a panel. On `--card`, edged with a hairline. No icon and no tone badge.
- **The landing page reads as a summary.** What needs somebody comes first, in the banner; then the four figures, set larger than figures anywhere else, because they are the answer; then the controls to change the selection; then the detail. A reader who stops after two seconds has still had the point.
- **The banner** — one to a page, at the top of the landing page, above the figures, carrying one message: on the demo, the requests that have waited over a week with nothing recorded. `buildBanner()` can carry a second line for a board whose other waiting items have no home below, but a count a panel already shows (arrivals today, one-word replies) is not said again in the banner, and no figure card repeats the banner's figure. Every count is true right now and the link goes to the list it counts, not to part of it. With nothing waiting it says so on a calm green rather than disappearing, because "nothing is waiting" is an answer and a blank space is not.
- **The filter bar** — the period, the product and a search on the row, shared through `assets/js/shared/filters.js` so no two pages can count the same selection differently. The state lives in the query string, so a view can be sent to somebody. Under the row, **Showing 12 of 59 requests · Billing** appears only while something is filtered, with **Show everything** beside the row.
- **More filters** — the filters a page reaches for less often (on the demo, the person) and the saved views, behind one secondary button at the end of the filter row. It opens by itself on arrival when one of its filters is set or the address is a saved view, so a set filter is never hidden; while closed it counts them (**More filters · 1**); open, it reads **Fewer filters**. It carries `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`, and moves focus to the first control it reveals. Where only saved views would sit behind it, it is labelled **Saved views** instead (`label: 'Saved views'`). On a phone it spans the row. Built once, by `moreFilters(countOn, { button, set, label })` in `assets/js/shared/app.js`, and placed by `filters()` in `tools/build-pages.js`, so every page and every board built from the kit gets the same one.
- **Saved views** — a picker and one button, behind **More filters**. The button's label is always what pressing it will do: **Save this view** when the selection on screen is not saved, **Remove this view** when it is. Naming takes the row to itself rather than sitting beside the picker, so the bar never offers two ways to do one thing. A view is the page's query string with its parameters sorted, so the same choices made in a different order are the same view. They belong to the page they were saved on, because the same query means different things on two pages with different filters. **They are kept in this browser only** — not shared, not synced, not backed up — and the board says so every time one is saved, along with the thing that does work: the page link already carries the selection.
- **Your own line on a figure** — set inside the (i), where the figure already explains what it counts, because somebody deciding where to put a line is already reading that. A crossed line shows as a chip above the figure's own line, reading **past your line, above 8 hours**. It sits apart from the board's movement on purpose: one is what the board worked out, the other is what you asked it to watch, and the words say which is which. A figure the board could not read is never past a line: a dash is not a number, and treating it as zero would invent a crossing.
- **Drill-down tiles** — `.status-tile` for a state or a band. Opening one puts the step in the hash, so the browser's back button works and a link can be shared.
- **The drop zone** — `.drop`, on Your data. A dashed edge, and the only dashed edge on the board: everything else is a surface, and this is a place something goes. It fills with `--accent-soft` while a file is over it, which is the one piece of feedback a drag has.
- **Tables** — `.results`, with an optional tick column. On a phone the heading row is dropped and every cell carries its own heading through `labelCells()`.

**Saved views is the one component the components page does not demonstrate.** A working one there would let somebody save views of a page of examples, which is meaningless; a dead one on a page of live components is worse. It is described here instead.

**What the board is reading is part of the shell, not a page.** The footer line, the state line under the menu and the refresh note all change when the rows do. A board showing somebody's own file must not say "sample data" underneath it, and a board showing the demo must not imply it is showing anything real. Both sentences live in `BOARD`, and both are written twice — once for each case — rather than once and hedged.

**The board's rules and the reader's rules are kept apart.** The banner says what needs somebody according to rules this board was built with. A line on a figure is the other thing: a threshold the reader drew, which the board had no opinion about until they drew it. They are never merged into one list, because a reader should be able to tell at a glance whether the board is reporting something it worked out or something they asked it to watch.

**It is a line, not an alert.** Nothing is sent, because there is no server to send it. A line shows when the board is opened and at no other time, and the page says so every time one is set. A board that cannot reach you must not use a word that promises it can — which is why nothing in this kit calls it an alert.

## The three states

A board is always in one of three states, and all three are drawn:

- **Waiting** — a quiet stand-in with the shape of what is coming, so the page does not jump when the real content lands. No spinner: a spinner says "wait" without saying what for.
- **Ready** — the board.
- **Failed** — what went wrong, in the source's own words; a line saying what it does *not* mean; and a **Try again** that re-runs the same path rather than reloading the page. An empty board and a board that could not load are different things, and the second one says so.

The failure panel takes focus and is announced, because a page that silently stops is worse than one that says it stopped.

**A table caps at 200 rows and names what it capped.** Showing the first two hundred silently would be showing part of the answer and calling it the answer, which is the thing this board exists not to do. The export still saves everything.

## The address bar

Two different things, kept apart:

- **Filters live in the query string** (`?range=week&product=billing`), set with `history.replaceState`, so typing in a search box does not fill the history with a hundred entries.
- **Where you are inside a page lives in the hash** (`#8-14`), set with `pushState`, so back means back.

## The parts the browser draws

Text selection, the caret, the checkbox tick and the scrollbar all ship with defaults that belong to no design system, so they are themed from the palette like anything else. It costs four declarations and it is the clearest signal that a page was built rather than assembled.

## Accessibility

- Every page opens with a skip link, and `<main>` takes focus when a drill-down opens.
- The menu is `inert` when closed on a phone, so a keyboard and a screen reader skip it.
- Redrawing a list would drop focus to the top of the page, so buttons carry a `data-focus` key and focus lands back on the matching one.
- Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. There is very little of it: colour changes on hover, the toast entering and leaving, and **More filters** fading its controls in over 150ms on `--ease-out` (opacity only, through `@starting-style`, no slide). Under reduced motion the fade is off.
- Colour is never the only carrier of meaning: a chip has words in it, and a chart has a key.
